# training SEDs 
scripts for constructing the training SEDs with different setups 

## Model A 
`modela.py`: standard `provabgs` setup as specified in the mock challenge
paper. The SEDs will span the observed-frame wavelength range of 0.1 to 30 micron 
and redshift 0 < z < 1. This model, however, doesn't include dust emission properly.
