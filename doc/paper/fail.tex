\section{Outside \sedflow Support} \label{sec:fail}
For a number of NSA galaxies, 591 out of 33,883, \sedflow~does not produce
valid posteriors
The normalizing flow of \sedflow~generates posteriors that are entirely outside
of the prior volume. 
This is driven by NSA galaxies that are outside of the support of the
\sedflow~training data. 
They lie outside of the support for two reasons: (1) some have unusually high
photometric uncertainties that are accounted for in our noise model and
(2) some have photometric colors that cannot be modeled by our SED model.
