science cases in terms of provisional plans for a 300-night Subaru
survey. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via a
survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3
h-3 Gpc3 in the redshift range 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless}
2.4. In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be
measured to 3\% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale,
and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth
to 6\% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities
and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used
to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the
structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for
106 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams
as faint as V ˜ 22, including stars with V {\textless} 20 to complement
the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to
be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple
α-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic
stars. For the galaxy evolution program, our simulations suggest the
wide wavelength range of PFS will be powerful in probing the galaxy
population and its clustering over a wide redshift range. We plan to
conduct a color-selected survey of 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 galaxies and AGN over
16 deg2 to J ≃ 23.4, yielding a fair sample of galaxies
with stellar masses above ˜1010 M⊙ at z
≃ 2. A two-tiered survey of higher redshift Lyman break galaxies
and Lyman alpha emitters will quantify the properties of early systems
close to the reionization epoch.},

	abstract = {Standard present-day large-scale structure (LSS) analyses make a major assumption in their Bayesian parameter inference - that the likelihood has a Gaussian form. For summary statistics currently used in LSS, this assumption, even if the underlying density field is Gaussian, cannot be correct in detail. We investigate the impact of this assumption on two recent LSS analyses: the Beutler et al. power spectrum multipole (Pℓ) analysis and the Sinha et al. group multiplicity function (ζ) analysis. Using non-parametric divergence estimators on mock catalogues originally constructed for covariance matrix
estimation, we identify significant non-Gaussianity in both the
Pℓ and ζ likelihoods. We then use Gaussian mixture
density estimation and independent component analysis on the same mocks to construct likelihood estimates that approximate the true likelihood better than the Gaussian pseudo-likelihood. Using these likelihood estimates, we accurately estimate the true posterior probability distribution of the Beutler et al. and Sinha et al. parameters.
Likelihood non-Gaussianity shifts the fσ8 constraint by -0.44σ, but otherwise does not significantly impact the overall
parameter constraints of Beutler et al. For the ζ analysis, using the pseudo-likelihood significantly underestimates the uncertainties and biases the constraints of the Sinha et al. halo occupation parameters. For log M\_1 and α, the posteriors are shifted by +0.43σ and
-0.51σ and broadened by 42\{\{ per cent\}\} and 66\{\{ per cent\}\},
respectively. The divergence and likelihood estimation methods we present provide a straightforward framework for quantifying the impact of likelihood non-Gaussianity and deriving more accurate parameter constraints.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01497},
	abstract = {Many statistical models in cosmology can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihood functions. Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we introduce density estimation likelihood-free inference, which learns a parameterized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate density estimation likelihood-free inference with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological datasets.},

	abstract = {Standard approaches to Bayesian parameter inference in large scale structure assume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the likelihood. This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

	abstract = {We measure star formation rates of {\textasciitilde}50,000 optically-selected galaxies in the local universe (z{\textasciitilde}0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

It accurately recovers traditional SED parameters, including M\$\_*\$, SFR and dust attenuation, and reveals previously inaccessible information about the number and duration of star formation episodes and the timing of stellar mass assembly, as well as uncertainties in these quantities. This is done using basis Star Formation Histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at \$z =1\$ drawn from stochastic realisations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a sample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at \$1{\textless}z{\textless}1.5\$ to illustrate its capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential, bessel-exponential, lognormal and gaussian SFHs and reject the traditional parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the bias and scatter of each parametrization. \$15{\textbackslash}\%\$ of galaxies in our CANDELS sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction decreasing above \$M\_*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. About \$40{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the CANDELS galaxies have SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation.

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass σ{\textasciitilde}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2
Msolar and σ{\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfvénic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following: 1) including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z{\textasciitilde}0 carry errors of {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z{\textasciitilde}2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.6 dex level; 2) either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.4 mag level in the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors blueward of the V-band.

	abstract = {The study of stellar populations in galaxies is entering a new era with 
the availability of large and high-quality data bases of both observed
galactic spectra and state-of-the-art evolutionary synthesis models. In
this paper we investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a means to
estimate the physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is
nothing more than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of
a superposition of a base of simple stellar populations of various ages
and metallicities, producing as output the star formation and chemical
histories of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. Our
implementation of this method uses the recent models of Bruzual \&
Charlot and observed spectra in the 3650-8000 Å range. The
reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1)
simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different
technique, and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a
sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable physical parameters as
long as one does not attempt a very detailed description of the star
formation and chemical histories. Robust and physically interesting
parameters are obtained by combining the (individually uncertain)
strengths of each simple stellar population in the base. In particular,
we show that, besides providing excellent fits to observed galaxy
spectra, this method is able to recover useful information on the
distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly, stellar
metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are
also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise
ratios.

We apply this synthesis method to a volume-limited sample of 50362
galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalogue of stellar
population properties. Emission lines are also studied, their
measurement being performed after subtracting the computed starlight
spectrum from the observed one. A comparison with recent estimates of
both observed and physical properties of these galaxies obtained by
other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement, despite
substantial differences in the methods of analysis. The confidence in
the present method is further strengthened by several empirical and
astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and
independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong
correlations between stellar and nebular metallicities, stellar and
nebular extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Hα
and 4000-Å break, and between stellar mass and velocity
dispersion.},

This flexible tool, named BEAGLE (for BayEsian Analysis of GaLaxy sEds), allows one to build mock galaxy catalogues as well as to interpret any combination of photometric and spectroscopic galaxy observations in terms of physical parameters. The current version of the tool includes versatile modeling of the emission from stars and photoionized gas, attenuation by dust and accounting for different instrumental effects, such as spectroscopic flux calibration and line spread function. We show a first application of the BEAGLE tool to the interpretation of broadband SEDs of a published sample of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}10{\textasciicircum}4\$ galaxies at redshifts \$0.1 {\textbackslash}lesssim z{\textbackslash}lesssim8\$. We find that the constraints derived on photometric redshifts using this multi-purpose tool are comparable to those obtained using public, dedicated photometric-redshift codes and quantify this result in a rigorous statistical way. We also show how the post-processing of BEAGLE output data with the Python extension PYP-BEAGLE allows the characterization of systematic deviations between models and observations, in particular through posterior predictive checks. The modular design of the BEAGLE tool allows easy extensions to incorporate, for example, the absorption by neutral galactic and circumgalactic gas, and the emission from an active galactic nucleus, dust and shock-ionized gas. Information about public releases of the BEAGLE tool will be maintained on http://www.jacopochevallard.org/beagle.},

stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a
challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived
from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or
more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher
accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically
designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector- α,
includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation
curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component
nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the
parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within
the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased
parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model
with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the
fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the
broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model
predicts Hα luminosities with a scatter of ˜0.18 dex and an
offset of ˜0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and
stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the Hα luminosity
is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and
stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive
Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and
metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and Hδ. Although
the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet
assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered
stellar masses.},

	abstract = {Cosmological inference becomes increasingly difficult when complex 
data-generating processes cannot be modeled by simple probability
distributions. With the ever-increasing size of data sets in cosmology,
there is an increasing burden placed on adequate modeling; systematic
errors in the model will dominate where previously these were swamped by
statistical errors. For example, Gaussian distributions are an
insufficient representation for errors in quantities like photometric
redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult to quantify analytically the
distribution of errors that are introduced in complex fitting codes.
Without a simple form for these distributions, it becomes difficult to
accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as a function of
parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) provides
a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation of
a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to
bypass direct calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the
ability to simulate the forward process that generated the data. These
simulations can naturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance
parameters, and hence these can be marginalized in a natural way. We
present and discuss ABC methods in the context of supernova cosmology
using data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. Assuming a flat cosmology
and constant dark energy equation of state, we demonstrate that ABC can
recover an accurate posterior distribution. Finally, we show that ABC
can still produce an accurate posterior distribution when we contaminate
the sample with Type IIP supernovae.},

	abstract = {'Approximate Bayesian Computation' (ABC) represents a powerful 
methodology for the analysis of complex stochastic systems for which the
likelihood of the observed data under an arbitrary set of input
parameters may be entirely intractable - the latter condition rendering
useless the standard machinery of tractable likelihood-based, Bayesian
statistical inference [e.g. conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation]. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of ABC for
astronomical model analysis by application to a case study in the
morphological transformation of high-redshift galaxies. To this end, we
develop, first, a stochastic model for the competing processes of
merging and secular evolution in the early Universe, and secondly,
through an ABC-based comparison against the observed demographics of
massive (Mgal {\textgreater} 1011 M⊙)
galaxies (at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3) in the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep
Extragalatic Legacy Survey (CANDELS)/Extended Groth Strip (EGS) data set
we derive posterior probability densities for the key parameters of this
model. The 'Sequential Monte Carlo' implementation of ABC exhibited
herein, featuring both a self-generating target sequence and
self-refining MCMC kernel, is amongst the most efficient of contemporary
approaches to this important statistical algorithm. We highlight as well
through our chosen case study the value of careful summary statistic
selection, and demonstrate two modern strategies for assessment and
optimization in this regard. Ultimately, our ABC analysis of the
high-redshift morphological mix returns tight constraints on the
evolving merger rate in the early Universe and favours major merging
(with disc survival or rapid reformation) over secular evolution as the
mechanism most responsible for building up the first generation of
bulges in early-type discs.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Hα to Hβ luminosities, the Hα equivalent width, and the
ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A
noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale 
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution
simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has
a dark mass resolution of 6.26 × 106 M⊙,
and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 ×
106 M⊙. At z = 0 gravitational forces are
softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells
have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 ×
18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve
18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle
count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes:
primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections,
stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment,
supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic
nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic
predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with
observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume
contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of
morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular
galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star
formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon
conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the
impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The
internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies
obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat
circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation
reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our
model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the
halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from
supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r 50 {\textasciitilde} 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog
underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a
substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data.},

the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star
formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a
plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for
which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future
observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic
mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar
mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles
around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total
baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different
redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution
of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i)
present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0,
for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance
in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies
selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth

This idea has not yielded much practical success, presumably because of the noise and incompleteness in chemical-abundance measurements. We have succeeded in substantially improving spectroscopic measurements with The Cannon, which has now delivered 15 individual abundances for {\textasciitilde}100,000 stars observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with precisions around 0.04 dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in phase space. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars in the 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The Cannon, and plot the associated stars in phase space. We use only abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify stellar groups. We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed clusters in phase space. We recover some known phase-space clusters and find other interesting structures. This is the first-ever project to identify phase-space structures at survey-scale by blind search purely in abundance space; it verifies the precision of the abundance measurements delivered by The Cannon; the prospects for future data sets appear very good.},

	abstract = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an
interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

	abstract = {Context. This is the third in a series of papers that develop a new and 
flexible model to predict weak-lensing (WL) peak counts, which have been
shown to be a very valuable non-Gaussian probe of cosmology. 
Aims: In this paper, we compare the cosmological information extracted
from WL peak counts using different filtering techniques of the galaxy
shear data, including linear filtering with a Gaussian and two
compensated filters (the starlet wavelet and the aperture mass), and the
nonlinear filtering method MRLens. We present improvements to our model
that account for realistic survey conditions, which are masks,
shear-to-convergence transformations, and non-constant noise. 
Methods: We create simulated peak counts from our stochastic model, from
which we obtain constraints on the matter density Ωm,
the power spectrum normalisation σ8, and the
dark-energy parameter w0de. We use two methods for
parameter inference, a copula likelihood, and approximate Bayesian
computation (ABC). We measure the contour width in the
Ωm-σ8 degeneracy direction and the
figure of merit to compare parameter constraints from different
filtering techniques. Results: We find that starlet filtering
outperforms the Gaussian kernel, and that including peak counts from
different smoothing scales helps to lift parameter degeneracies. Peak
counts from different smoothing scales with a compensated filter show
very little cross-correlation, and adding information from different
scales can therefore strongly enhance the available information.
Measuring peak counts separately from different scales yields tighter
constraints than using a combined peak histogram from a single map that
includes multiscale information. Conclusions: Our results suggest
that a compensated filter function with counts included separately from
different smoothing scales yields the tightest constraints on
cosmological parameters from WL peaks.},

far-infrared (FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
from the far-UV (FUV) to the FIR are available. We compared the observed
SEDs to modelled SEDs with several star formation histories (SFHs;
decaying star formation rate plus burst) and dust attenuation laws
(power law + 2175 Åbump). The Bayesian method allows one to
estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each observed
SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the UV
dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from SED analysis if the
FIR information is not used. The dispersion is larger than with the FIR
data. The distribution is also not symmetrically distributed about zero:
there is an overestimation for UV-selected galaxies and an
underestimation for FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis
process suggests that UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in
average similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud extinction law while
FIR-selected galaxies attenuation laws resemble more the Milky Way
extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the log
(Fdust/FFUV) versus FUV-NUV diagram (once the main
relation with FUV - NUV accounted for) is explained by two other
parameters: the slope of the attenuation law and the instantaneous
birthrate parameters b0 for UV-selected galaxies and the same
ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected galaxies. We
propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for UV galaxies
only (that should only be used whenever the FIR information is not
available because the resulting AFUV is poorly defined with
an uncertainty of about 0.32): AFUV= 1.4168

	abstract = {This Letter utilizes composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) 
constructed from NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey photometry to constrain the
dust attenuation curve in 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.0 galaxies. Based on
similarities between the full SED shapes (0.3-8 μm), we have divided
galaxies in 32 different spectral classes and stacked their photometry.
As each class contains galaxies over a range in redshift, the resulting
rest-frame SEDs are well sampled in wavelength and show various spectral
features including Hα and the UV dust bump at 2175 Å. We fit
all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population synthesis models,
while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV bump
strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV
wavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we
find that the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There
is a strong correlation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump
strength, with steeper laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the
attenuation curve correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR),
with more active galaxies having shallower dust curves and weaker bumps.
There is also a weak correlation with inclination. The observed trends
can be explained by differences in the dust-to-star geometry, a varying
grain size distribution, or a combination of both. Our results have
several implications for galaxy evolution studies. First, the assumption
of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived galaxy properties.
Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in underestimated values
for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant galaxies.},

	abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the “gold standard” for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes a priori. However, this flexibility is not fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here, we use the SED-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior star formation rate as a function of time (SFR(t)) is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of ̃6000 galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey and measure scatters between priors to be 0.1 dex in mass, 0.8 dex in SFR{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}100 Myr{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and 0.2 dex in mass-weighted ages, with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED fitting. High-quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t).},

Recently we have proposed that sophisticated panchromatic SED models can resolve this tension, as these methods infer systematically higher masses and lower star formation rates than standard approaches. In a series of papers we now extend this analysis and present a complete, self-consistent census of galaxy formation over \$0.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 3\$ inferred with the {\textbackslash}texttt\{Prospector\} galaxy SED-fitting code. In this work, Paper I, we present the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function using new mass measurements of \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\${\textasciicircum}5\$ galaxies in the 3D-HST and COSMOS-2015 surveys. We employ a new methodology to infer the mass function from the observed stellar masses: instead of fitting independent mass functions in a series of fixed redshift intervals, we construct a continuity model that directly fits for the redshift evolution of the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly and makes use of the full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar mass inferences. The resulting mass function has higher number densities at a fixed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature, largely owing to the older stellar ages inferred by {\textbackslash}texttt\{Prospector\}. The stellar mass density is \${\textbackslash}sim\$50\% higher than previous measurements, with the offset peaking at \$z{\textbackslash}sim1\$. The next two papers in this series will present the new measurements of star-forming main sequence and the cosmic star formation rate density, respectively. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}},

For that reason, it has recently been gaining popularity as an analysis tool in cosmology and astrophysics. Its drawback, however, is a slow convergence rate. We propose a novel method, which we call qABC, to accelerate ABC with Quantile Regression. In this method, we create a model of quantiles of distance measure as a function of input parameters. This model is trained on a small number of simulations and estimates which regions of the prior space are likely to be accepted into the posterior. Other regions are then immediately rejected. This procedure is then repeated as more simulations are available. We apply it to the practical problem of estimation of redshift distribution of cosmological samples, using forward modelling developed in previous work. The qABC method converges to nearly same posterior as the basic ABC. It uses, however, only 20\% of the number of simulations compared to basic ABC, achieving a fivefold gain in execution time for our problem. For other problems the acceleration rate may vary; it depends on how close the prior is to the final posterior. We discuss possible improvements and extensions to this method.},

	abstract = {We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to 
interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of
galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and
near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing
angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by
dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient interstellar medium
(ISM) in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the
power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three
components: a component of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); a
mid-infrared continuum characterizing the emission from hot grains at
temperatures in the range 130-250 K; and a component of grains in
thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 30-60 K. In
the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these
three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus
emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in
thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 15-25 K.
Our model is both simple and versatile enough that it can be used to
derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust
contents of large samples of galaxies using a wide range of ultraviolet,
optical and infrared observations. We illustrate this by deriving median
likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses,
effective dust optical depths, dust masses and relative strengths of
different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star-forming
galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). We
explore how the constraints derived in this way depend on the available
spectral information. From our analysis of the SINGS sample, we conclude
that the mid- and far-infrared colours of galaxies correlate strongly
with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide
quantities connected to this parameter, such as the ratio of infrared
luminosity between stellar birth clouds and the ambient ISM, the
contributions by PAHs and grains in thermal equilibrium to the total
infrared emission, and the ratio of dust mass to stellar mass. Our model
can be straightforwardly applied to interpret ultraviolet, optical and
infrared spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample.},

	abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the
extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete
evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based
Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS
adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical
recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when
many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline
mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M ⊙ stars through
the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival
on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular
momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of
rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows
the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This
enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst,
and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way
in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and
composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of
MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the
modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and
atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA
Software Development Kit that packages all the required components

New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks

Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA,
enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from
pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and
nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE
non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations
of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the
astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of
mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A
new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates
“on-the-fly” from input nuclear data allows better
simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the
fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical
diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit
improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative
levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the

With the fully Bayesian framework Prospector, we simultaneously fit the
spectroscopic and photometric data with an advanced physical model (including non-parametric star-formation histories, emission lines, variable dust attenuation law, and dust and AGN emission) together with an uncertainty and outlier model. We show that both spectroscopy and photometry are needed to break the dust-age-metallicity degeneracy. We find a large diversity of star-formation histories: although the most massive (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textgreater}2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) galaxies formed the earliest (formation redshift of \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm f\}{\textbackslash}approx5-10\$ with a short star-formation timescale of \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SF\}{\textbackslash}lesssim1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$), lower-mass galaxies have a wide range of formation redshifts, leading to only a weak trend of \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm f\}\$ with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$. Interestingly, several low-mass galaxies with have formation redshifts of \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm f\}{\textbackslash}approx5-8\$. Star-forming galaxies evolve about the star-forming main sequence, crossing the ridgeline several times in their past. Quiescent galaxies show a wide range and continuous distribution of quenching timescales (\${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm quench\}{\textbackslash}approx0-5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$) with a median of \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm quench\}{\textbackslash}rangle=1.0\_\{-0.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ and of quenching epochs of \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm quench\}{\textbackslash}approx0.8-5.0\$ (\${\textbackslash}langle z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm quench\}{\textbackslash}rangle=1.3\_\{-0.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\$). This large diversity of quenching timescales and epochs points toward a combination of internal and external quenching mechanisms. In our sample, rejuvenation and "late bloomers" are uncommon. In summary, our analysis supports the "grow \& quench" framework and is consistent with a wide and
continuously-populated diversity of quenching timescales.},

Rich Early ENvironments (GOGREEN) survey. We determine the SFHs of
individual galaxies by simultaneously fitting rest-frame optical

confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more massive galaxies having
on average earlier formation times. Comparing galaxies found in massive

We constrain the difference in mass-weighted ages between field and
cluster galaxies to \$0.31\_\{{\textasciicircum}\{-0.33\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\_\{+0.51\}\}\$ Gyr, in the sense
that cluster galaxies are older. We place this result in the context of
two simple quenching models and show that neither environmental
quenching based on time since infall (without pre-processing) nor a
difference in formation times alone can reproduce both the average age
difference and relative quenched fractions. This is distinctly different
from local clusters, for which the majority of the quenched population
is consistent with having been environmentally quenched upon infall. Our
results suggest that quenched population in galaxy clusters at z {\textgreater} 1

	abstract = {We present a full sky 100micron map that is a reprocessed composite of 
the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and
confirmed point sources removed. We have constructed a map of the dust
temperature, so that the 100micron map can be converted to a map
proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17
K to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust
column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with
DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary
detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes.
In high latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of HI
emission, but deviations are significant. To generate the full sky dust
maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination as well as a
possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). For the 100micron map no
signficant CIB is detected, but in the 140micron and 240micron maps,
where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at
surprisingly high flux levels of 30 +/- 8 \{nW/m\}(2/sr) at 140{\textbackslash}micron,
and 16 {\textbackslash}pm 3.4 \{nW/m\}{\textasciicircum}2/sr at 240micron (95\% confidence), which is an
integrated flux {\textasciitilde} 2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the
Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a
new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a
standard reddening law, and use the colors of elliptical galaxies. We
demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older
Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate
reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in
regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for
estimating millimeter emission that contaminates CMBR experiments and
for estimating soft X-ray absorption.},

In the present work, we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. These data include ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR photometry, surface brightness fluctuations, and integrated spectra of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), M87, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and photometry and spectral indices of both quiescent and post-starburst galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 0. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual \& Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05), and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: (1) the FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age dependence is incorrect; (2) all models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J - K and V - K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; (3) FSPS is able to fit all of the ultraviolet data because both the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) and horizontal branch evolutionary phases are handled flexibly, while the BC03 and M05 models fail in the far-UV, and both far- and near-UV, respectively; (4) all models predict ugr colors too red, D n 4000 strengths too strong, and Hδ A strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; and (5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D n 4000, and Hδ A strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch (HB) stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main-sequence turnoff). The different model predictions in the near-IR for intermediate age systems are due to different treatments of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stellar evolutionary phase. We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.},

This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).},

	abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its extensions such as Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) have become prominent techniques for blind sources separation (BSS), analysis of image databases, data mining and other information retrieval and clustering applications. In this paper we propose a family of efficient algorithms for NMF/NTF, as well as sparse nonnegative coding and representation, that has many potential applications in computational neuroscience, multi-sensory processing, compressed sensing and multidimensional data analysis. We have developed a class of optimized local algorithms which are referred to as Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) algorithms. For these purposes, we have performed sequential constrained minimization on a set of squared Euclidean distances. We then extend this approach to robust cost functions using the alpha and beta divergences and derive flexible update rules. Our algorithms are locally stable and work well for NMF-based blind source separation (BSS) not only for the over-determined case but also for an under-determined (over-complete) case (i.e., for a system which has less sensors than sources) if data are sufficiently sparse. The NMF learning rules are extended and generalized for N-th order nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF). Moreover, these algorithms can be tuned to different noise statistics by adjusting a single parameter. Extensive experimental results confirm the accuracy and computational performance of the developed algorithms, especially, with usage of multi-layer hierarchical NMF approach [3].},

	abstract = {Slice Sampling has emerged as a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that adapts to the characteristics of the target distribution with minimal hand-tuning. However, Slice Sampling's performance is highly sensitive to the user-specified initial length scale hyperparameter. Moreover, Slice Sampling generally struggles with poorly scaled or strongly correlated distributions. This paper introduces Ensemble Slice Sampling, a new class of algorithms that bypasses such difficulties by adaptively tuning the length scale. Furthermore, Ensemble Slice Sampling's performance is immune to linear correlations by exploiting an ensemble of parallel walkers. These algorithms are trivial to construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel computing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can improve efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional MCMC methods on highly correlated target distributions such as the Autoregressive Process of Order 1 and the Correlated Funnel distribution.},

Strong gravitational lensing is one of the few methods that allow us to constrain the IMF outside of the Local Group. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The goal of this study is to statistically constrain the distribution in the IMF mismatch parameter, defined as the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and that inferred assuming a reference IMF, of massive galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) constant mass (CMASS) sample. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We took 23 strong lenses drawn from the CMASS sample, measured their Einstein radii and stellar masses using multi-band photometry from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, then fitted a model distribution for the IMF mismatch parameter and dark matter halo mass to the whole sample. We used a prior on halo mass from weak lensing measurements and accounted for strong lensing selection effects in our model. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Assuming a Navarro Frenk and White density profile for the dark matter distribution, we infer a value μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IMF{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -0.04 ± 0.11 for the average base-10 logarithm of the IMF mismatch parameter, defined with respect to a Chabrier IMF.

Under the assumption of standard Navarro, Frenk, and White dark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark matter contribution for each lens. We define an "IMF mismatch" parameter α≡M LD *,Ein/M SPS *,Ein as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensing and dynamical model (M LD *,Ein) to the current stellar mass inferred from stellar populations synthesis models (M SPS *,Ein). We find that a Salpeter IMF provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and dynamical models (langlog αrang = -0.00 ± 0.03 ± 0.02), while a Chabrier IMF underestimates them (langlog αrang = 0.25 ± 0.03 ± 0.02). A tentative trend is found, in the sense that α appears to increase with galaxy velocity dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non-universal IMF, perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark matter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion. While the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken without additional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannot have both a universal IMF and universal dark matter halos.

The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3Msolar (where Msolar is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80\% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60\% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1Msolar to 1Msolar.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies depends on their host environment. To this purpose, we have selected a sample of early-type galaxies from the SPIDER catalogue, characterized their environment through the group catalogue of Wang et al., and used their optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra to constrain the IMF slope, through the analysis of IMF-sensitive spectral indices. To reach a high enough signal-to-noise ratio, we have stacked spectra in velocity dispersion (σ0) bins, on top of separating the sample by galaxy hierarchy and host halo mass, as proxies for galaxy environment. In order to constrain the IMF, we have compared observed line strengths and predictions of MIUSCAT/EMILES synthetic stellar population models, with varying age, metallicity, and `bimodal' (low-mass tapered) IMF slope (Γ \_b). Consistent with previous studies, we find that Γ \_b increases with σ0, becoming bottom-heavy (i.e. an excess of low-mass stars with respect to the Milky Way like IMF) at high σ0. We find that this result is robust against the set of isochrones used in the stellar population models, as well as the way the effect of elemental abundance ratios is taken into account. We thus conclude that it is possible to use currently state-of-the-art stellar population models and intermediate resolution spectra to consistently probe IMF variations. For the first time, we show that there is no dependence of Γb on environment or galaxy hierarchy, as measured within the 3 arcsec SDSS fibre, thus leaving the IMF as an intrinsic galaxy property, possibly set already at high redshift.},

It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-Å break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index HδA. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-Å break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses {\textasciitilde}5× 1010Msolar, half-light radii {\textasciitilde}3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities {\textasciitilde}109 Msolar kpc-2.

	abstract = {Likelihood-free inference provides a framework for performing rigorous Bayesian inference using only forward simulations, properly accounting for all physical and observational effects that can be successfully included in the simulations. The key challenge for likelihood-free applications in cosmology, where simulation is typically expensive, is developing methods that can achieve high-fidelity posterior inference with as few simulations as possible. Density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) methods turn inference into a density-estimation task on a set of simulated data-parameter pairs, and give orders of magnitude improvements over traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference. In this paper, we use neural density estimators (NDEs) to learn the likelihood function from a set of simulated data sets, with active learning to adaptively acquire simulations in the most relevant regions of parameter space on the fly. We demonstrate the approach on a number of cosmological case studies, showing that for typical problems high-fidelity posterior inference can be achieved with just O(10{\textasciicircum}3) simulations or fewer. In addition to enabling efficient simulation-based inference, for simple problems where the form of the likelihood is known, DELFI offers a fast alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, giving orders of magnitude speed-up in some cases. Finally, we introduce PYDELFI - a flexible public implementation of DELFI with NDEs and active learning - available at https://github.com/justinalsing/pydelfi.},

	abstract = {High resolution galaxy spectra contain much information about galactic physics, but the high dimensionality of these spectra makes it difficult to fully utilize the information they contain. We apply variational autoencoders (VAEs), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, to a sample of spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In contrast to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a widely used technique, VAEs can capture non-linear relationships between latent parameters and the data. We find that a VAE can reconstruct the SDSS spectra well with only six latent parameters, outperforming PCA with the same number of components. Different galaxy classes are naturally separated in this latent space, without class labels having been given to the VAE. The VAE latent space is interpretable because the VAE can be used to make synthetic spectra at any point in latent space. For example, making synthetic spectra along tracks in latent space yields sequences of realistic spectra that interpolate between two different types of galaxies. Using the latent space to find outliers may yield interesting spectra: in our small sample, we immediately find unusual data artifacts and stars misclassified as galaxies. In this exploratory work, we show that VAEs create compact, interpretable latent spaces that capture non-linear features of the data. While a VAE takes substantial time to train ({\textasciitilde}1 day for 48000 spectra), once trained, VAEs can enable the fast exploration of large astronomical data sets.},

In recent years the quality and quantity of the available data has increased, and there have been corresponding efforts to increase the realism of the stellar population models used to interpret these observations. Describing the observed galaxy spectral energy distributions in detail now requires physical models with a large number of highly correlated parameters. These models do not fit easily on grids and necessitate a full exploration of the available parameter space. We present prospector, a flexible code for inferring stellar population parameters from photometry and spectroscopy spanning UV through IR wavelengths. This code is based on forward modeling the data and Monte Carlo sampling the posterior parameter distribution, enabling complex models and exploration of moderate dimensional parameter spaces. We describe the key ingredients of the code and discuss the general philosophy driving the design of these ingredients. We demonstrate some capabilities of the code on several datasets, including mock and real data.},

Using neural networks as surrogates for Bayesian posterior distributions, we analyze eight gravitational-wave events from the first LIGO-Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog and find very close quantitative agreement with standard inference codes, but with inference times reduced from O(day) to a minute per event. Our networks are trained using simulated data, including an estimate of the detector-noise characteristics near the event. This encodes the signal and noise models within millions of neural-network parameters, and enables inference for any observed data consistent with the training distribution, accounting for noise nonstationarity from event to event. Our algorithm -- called "DINGO" -- sets a new standard in fast-and-accurate inference of physical parameters of detected gravitational-wave events, which should enable real-time data analysis without sacrificing accuracy.},

This necessitates approximations and assumptions, which can lead to incorrect inference of cosmological parameters, including the nature of dark matter and dark energy, or create artificial model tensions. Likelihood-free inference covers a novel family of methods to rigorously estimate posterior distributions of parameters using forward modelling of mock data. We present likelihood-free cosmological parameter inference using weak lensing maps from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification data, using neural data compression of weak lensing map summary statistics. We explore combinations of the power spectra, peak counts, and neural compressed summaries of the lensing mass map using deep convolution neural networks. We demonstrate methods to validate the inference process, for both the data modelling and the probability density estimation steps. Likelihood-free inference provides a robust and scalable alternative for rigorous large-scale cosmological inference with galaxy survey data (for DES, Euclid, and LSST). We have made our simulated lensing maps publicly available.},

DEVILS is a deep spectroscopic redshift survey with very high completeness, covering several premier deep fields including COSMOS (D10). Our stellar mass and SFR estimates are self-consistently derived using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling code PROSPECT, using well-motivated parametrizations for dust attenuation, star formation histories, and metallicity evolution. We show how these improvements, and especially our physically motivated assumptions about metallicity evolution, have an appreciable systematic effect on the inferred stellar masses, at the level of {\textasciitilde}0.2 dex. To illustrate the scientific value of these data, we map the evolving galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) and the SFR-M⋆ relation for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 4.25. In agreement with past studies, we find that most of the evolution in the SMF is driven by the characteristic density parameter, with little evolution in the characteristic mass and low-mass slopes. Where the SFR-M⋆ relation is indistinguishable from a power law at z {\textgreater} 2.6, we see evidence of a bend in the relation at low redshifts (z {\textless} 0.45). This suggests evolution in both the normalization and shape of the SFR-M⋆ relation since cosmic noon. It is significant that we only clearly see this bend when combining our new DEVILS measurements with consistently derived values for lower redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey: this shows the power of having consistent treatment for galaxies at all redshifts.},

	abstract = {Three basic ingredients are required to generate a simple stellar population (SSP) library, i.e. an initial mass function (IMF), a stellar evolution model/isochrones, and an empirical/theoretical stellar spectral library. However, there are still some uncertainties to the determination and understanding of these ingredients. We perform the spectral fitting to test the relative parameter offsets between these uncertainties using two different stellar population models, two different empirical stellar libraries, two different isochrones, and the Salpeter and Chabrier IMFs. Based on these setups, we select five SSP libraries generated with the Galaxev/STELIB and Vazdekis/MILES models, and apply them to the pPXF full-spectrum fitting of both MaNGA and mock spectra. We find that: (1) Compared to the Galaxev/STELIB model, spectral fitting qualities with the Vazdekis/MILES model have significant improvements for those metal-rich (especially oversolar) spectra, which cause better reduced χ2 distributions and more precisely fitted absorption lines. This might due to the lack of metal-rich stars in the empirical STELIB library, or code improvement of the Vazdekis model. (2) When applying the Vazdekis/MILES model for spectral fitting, the IMF variation will lead to not only a systematic offset in M*/Lr, but also offsets in age and metallicity, and these offsets increase with increasing stellar population ages. However, the IMF variation caused metallicity offsets disappear in the case of Galaxev/STELIB based libraries. (3) The Padova2000 model provides a better match to the MaNGA galaxy spectra at [M/H]L {\textless} -1.0, while the BaSTI model match the local galaxy spectra better at [M/H]L {\textgreater} -1.0. Current tests suggest that spectral fitting with the Vazdekis/MILES + BaSTI combination would be a better choice for local galaxies.},

	abstract = {Because many of our X-ray telescopes are optimized towards observing faint sources, observations of bright sources like X-ray binaries in outburst are often affected by instrumental biases. These effects include dead time and photon pile-up, which can dramatically change the statistical inference of physical parameters from these observations. While dead time is difficult to take into account in a statistically consistent manner, simulating dead time-affected data is often straightforward. This structure makes the issue of inferring physical properties from dead time-affected observations fall into a class of problems common across many scientific disciplines. There is a growing number of methods to address them under the names of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), aided by new developments in density estimation and statistical machine learning. In this paper, we introduce SBI as a principled way to infer variability properties from dead time-affected light curves. We use Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation to estimate the posterior probability for variability properties. We show that this method can recover variability parameters on simulated data even when dead time is variable, and present results of an application of this approach to NuSTAR observations of the galactic black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105.},

	abstract = {Fast and automated inference of binary-lens, single-source (2L1S) microlensing events with sampling-based Bayesian algorithms (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo; MCMC) is challenged on two fronts: high computational cost of likelihood evaluations with microlensing simulation codes, and a pathological parameter space where the negative-log-likelihood surface can contain a multitude of local minima that are narrow and deep. Analysis of 2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-loop domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-free inference (LFI) approach named amortized neural posterior estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a surrogate posterior \${\textbackslash}hat\{p\}({\textbackslash}theta{\textbar}x)\$ as an observation-parametrized conditional probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors within seconds for any observation within the prior support without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior could then be refined into the exact posterior with a downstream MCMC sampler with minimal burn-in steps.},

(1994)]\{ref19\}, and [Bessell et al. (1989, 1991)]\{ref6\}, respectively. The combined library has been intended for multiple-purpose synthetic photometry applications and was constructed according to the precepts adopted by [Buser \&amp; Kurucz (1992)]\{ref14\}: (i) to cover the largest possible ranges in stellar parameters (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, log g, and [M/H]); (ii) to provide flux spectra with useful resolution on the uniform grid of wavelengths adopted by [Kurucz (1995)]\{ref26\}; and (iii) to provide synthetic broad--band colors which are highly realistic for the largest possible parameter and wavelength ranges. Because the most astrophysically relevant step consists in establishing a realistic library, the corresponding color calibration is described in some detail. Basically, for each value of the effective temperature and for each wavelength, we calculate the correction function that must be applied to a (theoretical) solar-abundance model flux spectrum in order for this to yield synthetic UBVRIJHKL colors matching the (empirical) color-temperature calibrations derived from observations. In this way, the most important systematic differences existing between the original model spectra and the observations can indeed be eliminated. On the other hand, synthetic UBV and Washington ultraviolet excesses delta\_\{(U-B)\} and delta\_\{(C-M)\} and delta\_\{(C-T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater})\} obtained from the original giant and dwarf model spectra are in excellent accord with empirical metal-abundance calibrations ([Lejeune \&amp; Buser 1996]\{ref30\}). Therefore, the calibration algorithm is designed in such a way as to preserve the original differential grid properties implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes in the new library, if the above correction function for a solar-abundance model of a given effective temperature is also applied to models of the same temperature but different chemical compositions [M/H] and/or surface gravities log g. While the new library constitutes a first-order approximation to the program set out above, it will be allowed to develop toward the more ambitious goal of matching the full requirements imposed on a standard library. Major input for refinement and completion is expected from the extensive tests now being made in population and evolutionary synthesis studies of the integrated light of globular clusters ([Lejeune 1997]\{ref29\}) and galaxies ([Bruzual et al. 1997]\{ref10\}).},

The grid includes M dwarf model spectra, hence complementing the first library version established in Paper I ({\textbackslash}cite[Lejeune et al. 1997]\{leje97\}). It covers wide ranges of fundamental parameters: \{T\_eff\}: 50 000 K {\textbackslash}sim 2000 K, ≶:break 5.5 {\textbackslash}sim -1.02, and \{[M/H]\}: +1.0 {\textbackslash}sim -5.0.

For this purpose, empirical \{T\_eff\}-color calibrations are constructed between 11500 K and 2000 K, and semi-empirical calibrations for non-solar abundances (\{[M/H]\} = -3.5 to +1.0) are established. Model colors and bolometric corrections for both the original and the corrected spectra, synthesized in the (UBV)\_J(RI)\_CJHKLL'M system, are given for the full range of stellar parameters. We find that the corrected spectra provide a more realistic representation of empirical stellar colors, though the method employed is not completely adapted to the lowest temperature models. In particular the original differential colors of the grid implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes are not preserved below 2500 K. Limitations of the correction method used are also discussed.

Surprisingly, we find that at the present epoch it is virtually impossible to establish a unique calibration of UBVRIJHKL colours in terms of stellar metallicity [Fe/H] which is consistent simultaneously with both colour-temperature relations and colour-absolute magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on observed globular cluster photometry data and on published, currently popular standard stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones. The problem appears to be related to the long-standing incompleteness in our understanding of convection in late-type stellar evolution, but is also due to a serious lack of relevant observational calibration data that would help resolve, or at least further significant progress towards resolving this issue. In view of the most important applications of the BaSeL library, we here propose two different metallicity calibration versions: (1) the ``WLBC 99'' library, which consistently matches empirical colour-temperature relations and which, therefore, should make an ideal tool for the study of individual stars; and (2), the ``PADOVA 2000'' library, which provides isochrones from the Padova 2000 grid (Girardi et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{padova\}) that successfully reproduce Galactic globular-cluster colour-absolute magnitude diagrams and which thus should prove particularly useful for studies of collective phenomena in stellar populations in clusters and galaxies.},

	abstract = {Modern spectroscopic surveys of galaxies such as MaNGA consist of millions of diverse spectra covering different regions of thousands of galaxies. We propose and implement a deep unsupervised machine learning method to summarize the entire diversity of MaNGA spectra onto a 15x15 map (DESOM-1), where neighbouring points on the map represent similar spectra. We demonstrate our method as an alternative to conventional full spectral fitting for deriving physical quantities, as well as their full probability distributions, much more efficiently than traditional resource-intensive Bayesian methods. Since spectra are grouped by similarity, the distribution of spectra onto the map for a single galaxy, i.e., its "fingerprint", reveals the presence of distinct stellar populations within the galaxy indicating smoother or episodic star-formation histories. We further map the diversity of galaxy fingerprints onto a second map (DESOM-2). Using galaxy images and independent measures of galaxy morphology, we confirm that galaxies with similar fingerprints have similar morphologies and inclination angles. Since morphological information was not used in the mapping algorithm, relating galaxy morphology to the star-formation histories encoded in the fingerprints is one example of how the DESOM maps can be used to make scientific inferences.},

Accurate and fast analysis of such large volumes of data under a statistical framework is therefore crucial for all sciences enabled by strong lensing. Here, we report on the application of simulation-based inference methods, in particular, density estimation techniques, to the predictions of the set of parameters of strong lensing systems from neural networks. This allows us to explicitly impose desired priors on lensing parameters, while guaranteeing convergence to the optimal posterior in the limit of perfect performance.},

In recent studies, emulators based on different machine learning techniques are used to emulate the outcomes of the population synthesis simulation with fast speed. In this study, we benchmark the performance of two emulators that learn the truncated power-law phenomenological model by using Gaussian process regression and normalizing flows techniques to see which one is a more capable likelihood emulator in the population inference. We benchmark the characteristic of the emulators by comparing their performance in the population inference to the phenomenological model using mock and real observation data. Our results suggest that the normalizing flows emulator can recover the posterior distribution by using the phenomenological model in the population inference with up to 300 mock injections. The normalizing flows emulator also underestimates the uncertainty for some posterior distributions in the population inference on real observation data. On the other hand, the Gaussian process regression emulator has poor performance on the same task and can only be used effectively in low-dimension cases.},

This limits the number of observable (e.g. chirp mass, spins.) and hyper-parameters (e.g. common envelope efficiency) one can use in a population inference. In this study, we train a network to emulate a phenomenological model with 6 observables and 4 hyper-parameters, use it to infer the properties of a simulated catalogue and compare the results to the phenomenological model. We find that a 10-layer network can emulate the phenomenological model accurately and efficiently.

However, existing methods are limited to a narrow range of proposal distributions or require importance weighting that can limit performance in practice. Here we present automatic posterior transformation (APT), a new sequential neural posterior estimation method for simulation-based inference. APT can modify the posterior estimate using arbitrary, dynamically updated proposals, and is compatible with powerful flow-based density estimators. It is more flexible, scalable and efficient than previous simulation-based inference techniques. APT can operate directly on high-dimensional time series and image data, opening up new applications for likelihood-free inference.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

	abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 μm map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 μm data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 μm map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 μm DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 μm flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 μm map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 μm and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 μm (95\% confidence). This integrated flux {\textasciitilde}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 μm emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a set of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint probability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint probability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be applied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized implementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art tractable distribution estimators.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

	abstract = {The DEIMOS spectrograph has now been installed on the Keck-II telescope and commissioning is nearly complete. The DEEP2 Redshift Survey, which will take approximately 120 nights at the Keck Observatory over a three year period and has been designed to utilize the power of DEIMOS, began in the summer of 2002. The multiplexing power and high efficiency of DEIMOS enables us to target 1000 faint galaxies per clear night. Our goal is to gather high-quality spectra of ≍ 60,000 galaxies with z{\textgreater}0.75 in order to study the properties and large scale clustering of galaxies at z ≍ 1. The survey will be executed at high spectral resolution, R=λ/Δλ ≍ 5000, allowing us to work between the bright OH sky emission lines and to infer linewidths for many of the target galaxies (for several thousand objects, we will obtain rotation curves as well). The linewidth data will facilitate the execution of the classical redshift-volume cosmological test, which can provide a precision measurement of the equation of state of the Universe. This talk reviews the project, summarizes our science goals and presents some early DEIMOS data.},

	abstract = {zCOSMOS is a large-redshift survey that is being undertaken in the COSMOS field using 600 hr of observation with the VIMOS spectrograph on the 8 m VLT. The survey is designed to characterize the environments of COSMOS galaxies from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 Mpc scale of the cosmic web and to produce diagnostic information on galaxies and active galactic nuclei. The zCOSMOS survey consists of two parts: (1) zCOSMOS-bright, a magnitude-limited I-band IAB{\textless}22.5 sample of about 20,000 galaxies with 0.12 COSMOS ACS field, for which the survey parameters at z{\textasciitilde}0.7 are designed to be directly comparable to those of the 2dFGRS at z{\textasciitilde}0.1 and (2) zCOSMOS-deep, a survey of approximately 10,000 galaxies selected through color-selection criteria to have 1.4 2. This paper describes the survey design and the construction of the target catalogs and briefly outlines the observational program and the data pipeline. In the first observing season, spectra of 1303 zCOSMOS-bright targets and 977 zCOSMOS-deep targets have been obtained. These are briefly analyzed to demonstrate the characteristics that may be expected from zCOSMOS, and particularly zCOSMOS-bright, when it is finally completed between 2008 and 2009. The power of combining spectroscopic and photometric redshifts is demonstrated, especially in correctly identifying the emission line in single-line spectra and in determining which of the less reliable spectroscopic redshifts are correct and which are incorrect. These techniques bring the overall success rate in the zCOSMOS-bright so far to almost 90\% and to above 97\% in the 0.5Based on observations undertaken at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) under Large Program 175.A-0839.

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 Å across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 Å for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary population synthesis models for a wide range of metallicities, ages, star formation histories, initial mass functions and horizontal branch morphologies, including blue morphologies at high metallicity, are computed. The model output comprises spectral energy distributions, colours, stellar M/L ratios, bolometric corrections and near-infrared (IR) spectral line indices. The energetics of the post main sequence evolutionary phases are evaluated with the fuel consumption theorem. The impact on the models of the stellar evolutionary tracks (in particular with and without overshooting) is assessed. We find modest differences in synthetic broad-band colours as induced by the use of different tracks in our code [e.g. Δ(V-K) {\textasciitilde} 0.08 mag, Δ(B-V) {\textasciitilde} 0.03 mag]. Noticeably, these differences are substantially smaller than the scatter among other models in the literature, even when the latter adopt the same evolutionary tracks. The models are calibrated with globular cluster data from the Milky Way for old ages, and the Magellanic clouds plus the merger remnant galaxy NGC 7252, both for young ages of {\textasciitilde}0.1-2Gyr, in a large wavelength range from the U band to the K band. Particular emphasis is put on the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. We show that this evolutionary phase is crucial for the modelling of young stellar populations by direct comparison with observed spectral energy distributions of Magellanic cloud clusters, which are characterized by relatively high fluxes, both blueward and redward of the V band. We find that the combination of the near-IR spectral indices C2 and H2O can be used to determine the metallicity of {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr stellar populations. As an illustrative application, we re-analyse the spectral energy distributions of some of the high-z galaxies (2.4 {\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2.9) observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope by Yan et al. Their high rest-frame near-IR fluxes is reproduced very well with the models including TP-AGB stars for ages in the range {\textasciitilde}0.6-1.5Gyr, suggesting formation redshifts for these objects around z{\textasciitilde} 3-6.},

VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic models. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is robustness as opposed to high-resolution histories, and the method is designed to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on the signal-to-noise ratio, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover between two and five stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.},

	abstract = {Fitting whole spectra at intermediate spectral resolution (R = 1000-3000), to derive physical properties of stellar populations, appears as an optimized alternative to methods based on spectrophotometric indices: it uses all the redundant information contained in the signal. This paper addresses the validation of the method and it investigates the quality of the population models together with the reliability of the fitting procedures. Our method compares observed optical spectra with models to derive the age, metallicity and line broadening due to the internal kinematics. It is insensitive to the shape of the continuum and the results are consistent with Lick indices but three times more precise. We are using two algorithms: STECKMAP, a non-parametric regularized program and NBURSTS a parametric non-linear minimization. We compare three spectral synthesis models for single stellar populations (SSPs): Pegase-HR, Galaxev and Vazdekis/Miles, and we analyse spectra of Galactic clusters whose populations are known from studies of colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and spectroscopy of individual stars. We find the following. (1) The quality of the models critically depends on the stellar library they use, and in particular on its coverage in age, metallicity and surface gravity of the stars. Pegase-HR and Vazdekis/Miles are consistent, while the comparison between Pegase-HR and Bruzual \& Charlot shows some systematics reflecting the limitations of the stellar library (STELIB) used to generate the latter models. (2) The two fitting programs are consistent. (3) For globular clusters and M67 spectra, the method restitutes metallicities in agreement with spectroscopy of stars with a precision of 0.14 dex. (4) The spectroscopic ages are very sensitive to the presence of a blue horizontal branch (BHB) or of blue stragglers. A BHB morphology results in a young SSP-equivalent age. Fitting a free amount of blue stars in addition to the SSP model to mimic the BHB improves and stabilizes the fit and restores ages in agreement with CMDs studies. This method is potentially able to disentangle age or BHB effects in extragalactic clusters. Full spectrum fitting is reliable method to derive the parameters of a stellar population.},

We compare its performance to grid-based algorithms, showing that the efficiency in CPU time is {\textasciitilde}100 times better for MCMC for a three-dimensional parameter space and increasing with the number of dimensions. We use GalMC to fit the stacked SEDs of two samples of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshift z = 3.1. Our fit reveals that the typical LAE detected in the IRAC 3.6 μm band has age = 0.67 [0.37-1.81] Gyr and stellar mass = 3.2 [2.5-4.2] × 109 M sun, while the typical LAE not detected at 3.6 μm has age = 0.06 [0.01-0.2] Gyr and stellar mass = 2 [1.1-3.4] × 108 M sun. The SEDs of both stacks are consistent with the absence of dust. The data do not significantly prefer exponential with respect to constant star formation history. The stellar populations of these two samples are consistent with the previous study by Lai et al., with some differences due to the improved modeling of the stellar populations. A constraint on the metallicity of z = 3.1 LAEs from broadband photometry, requiring Z {\textless} Z sun at 95\% confidence, is found here for the first time.},

By the use of a sophisticated physical plus systematic uncertainties model, constructed within the BAGPIPES code, we place strong constraints on the star-formation histories (SFHs) of individual objects. We first constrain the stellar mass versus stellar age relationship, finding a steep trend towards earlier average formation time with increasing stellar mass (downsizing) of 1.48{\textasciicircum}\{+0.34\}\_\{-0.39\} Gyr per decade in mass, although this shows signs of flattening at M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_⊙ . We show that this is consistent with other spectroscopic studies from 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2. This relationship places strong constraints on the AGN-feedback models used in cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that, although the relationships predicted by SIMBA and ILLUSTRISTNG agree well with observations at z = 0.1, they are too shallow at z = 1, predicting an evolution of ≲0.5 Gyr per decade in mass. Secondly, we consider the connections between green-valley, post-starburst, and quiescent galaxies, using our inferred SFH shapes and the distributions of galaxy physical properties on the UVJ diagram. The majority of our lowest-mass galaxies (M\_* ∼ 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} M\_⊙ ) are consistent with formation in recent (z {\textless} 2), intense starburst events, with time-scales of ≲500 Myr. A second class of objects experience extended star-formation epochs before rapidly quenching, passing through both green-valley and post-starburst phases. The most massive galaxies in our sample are extreme systems: already old by z = 1, they formed at z ∼ 5 and quenched by z = 3. However, we find evidence for their continued evolution through both AGN and rejuvenated star-formation activity.},

The surveys consist of deep, multiwavelength photometry and extensive Gemini GMOS spectroscopy of galaxies in 26 overdense systems ranging in halo mass from small groups to the most massive clusters. The objective of both projects was primarily to understand how the evolution of galaxies is affected by their environment, and to determine the physical processes that lead to the quenching of star formation. There was an emphasis on obtaining unbiased spectroscopy over a wide stellar mass range (M ≳ 2 × 1010 M⊙), throughout and beyond the cluster virialized regions. The final spectroscopic sample includes 2771 unique objects, of which 2257 have reliable spectroscopic redshifts. Of these, 1704 have redshifts in the range 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5, and nearly 800 are confirmed cluster members. Imaging spans the full optical and near-infrared wavelength range, at depths comparable to the UltraVISTA survey, and includes Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 F160W (GOGREEN) and F140W (GCLASS). This data release includes fully reduced images and spectra, with catalogues of advanced data products including redshifts, line strengths, star formation rates, stellar masses, and rest-frame colours.

	abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

	abstract = {This report describes the 2014 study by the Science Definition Team (SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

Here we instead present and motivate a method for unsupervised in-distribution anomaly detection using a conditional density estimator, designed to find unique, yet completely unknown, sets of samples residing in high probability density regions. We apply this method towards the detection of new physics in simulated Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle collisions as part of the 2020 LHC Olympics blind challenge, and show how we detected a new particle appearing in only 0.08\% of 1 million collision events. The results we present are our original blind submission to the 2020 LHC Olympics, where it achieved the state-of-the-art performance.},

	abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function, star formation rate density (SFRD), and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal, and double power-law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star formation rates (SFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR, and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3, and 0.2 dex, respectively. However, the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning that it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift z ∼ 0.05 are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at z ∼ 0.4, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning that our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper, we consider nonparametric SFH models.},

We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star formation histories (SFHs) by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9289 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, M* {\textgreater} 1010 M⊙ and redshifts 0.25 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.75. The majority of our sample exhibit SFHs that rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly over 1-2 Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At z {\textgreater} 1, we also find a class of objects with SFHs that rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching time-scales of {\textless}1 Gyr, consistent with quasar-mode AGN feedback. Finally, at z {\textless} 1 we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over {\textgreater}3 Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. We confirm the mass-accelerated evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards more rapid quenching at higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in quenching physics with stellar mass. We find 61 ± 8 per cent of z {\textgreater} 1.5 massive-quenched galaxies undergo significant further evolution by z = 0.5. BAGPIPES is available at bagpipes.readthedocs.io.},

	abstract = {We present SPECULATOR -- a fast, accurate, and flexible framework for emulating stellar population synthesis (SPS) models for predicting galaxy spectra and photometry. For emulating spectra, we use a principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of 103-104 speedup over direct SPS computation. They have readily computable derivatives, making them amenable to gradient-based inference and optimization methods. The emulators are also straightforward to call from a GPU, giving an additional order of magnitude speedup. Rapid SPS computations delivered by emulation offers a massive reduction in the computational resources required to infer the physical properties of galaxies from observed spectra or photometry and simulate galaxy populations under SPS models, while maintaining the accuracy required for a range of applications.},

	abstract = {The sampling of probability distributions specified up to a normalization constant is an important problem in both machine learning and statistical mechanics. While classical stochastic sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Langevin Dynamics (LD) can suffer from slow mixing times there is a growing interest in using normalizing flows in order to learn the transformation of a simple prior distribution to the given target distribution. Here we propose a generalized and combined approach to sample target densities: Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF) -- an arbitrary sequence of deterministic invertible functions and stochastic sampling blocks. We show that stochasticity overcomes expressivity limitations of normalizing flows resulting from the invertibility constraint, whereas trainable transformations between sampling steps improve efficiency of pure MCMC/LD along the flow. By invoking ideas from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics we derive an efficient training procedure by which both the sampler's and the flow's parameters can be optimized end-to-end, and by which we can compute exact importance weights without having to marginalize out the randomness of the stochastic blocks. We illustrate the representational power, sampling efficiency and asymptotic correctness of SNFs on several benchmarks including applications to sampling molecular systems in equilibrium.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220201809H},
	abstract = {The PRObabilistic Value-Added Bright Galaxy Survey (PROVABGS) catalog will provide measurements of galaxy properties, such as stellar mass (\$M\_*\$), star formation rate (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$), stellar metallicity (\$Z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm MW\}\$), and stellar age (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm age, MW\}\$), for {\textgreater}10 million galaxies of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey. Full posterior distributions of the galaxy properties will be inferred using state-of-the-art Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of DESI spectroscopy and Legacy Surveys photometry. In this work, we present the SED model, Bayesian inference framework, and methodology of PROVABGS. Furthermore, we apply the PROVABGS SED modeling on realistic synthetic DESI spectra and photometry, constructed using the L-GALAXIES semi-analytic model. We compare the inferred galaxy properties to the true galaxy properties of the simulation using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to quantify accuracy and precision. Overall, we accurately infer the true \$M\_*\$, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$, \$Z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm MW\}\$, and \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm age, MW\}\$ of the simulated galaxies. However, the priors on galaxy properties induced by the SED model have a significant impact on the posteriors. They impose a \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\{{\textgreater}\}10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot/\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}\$ lower bound on \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR\}\$, a \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.3\$ dex bias on \${\textbackslash}log Z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm MW\}\$ for galaxies with low spectral signal-to-noise, and \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm age, MW\} {\textless} 8{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$ upper bound on stellar age. This work also demonstrates that a joint analysis of spectra and photometry significantly improves the constraints on galaxy properties over photometry alone and is necessary to mitigate the impact of the priors. With the methodology presented and validated in this work, PROVABGS will maximize information extracted from DESI observations and provide a probabilistic value-added galaxy catalog that will extend current galaxy studies to new regimes and unlock cutting-edge probabilistic analyses.},
