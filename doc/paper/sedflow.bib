This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.},

  abstract = {Many statistical models in cosmology can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihood functions. Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we introduce density estimation likelihood-free inference, which learns a parameterized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate density estimation likelihood-free inference with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as \$\textbackslash sim 10\^4\$ simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological datasets.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

Within each SDSS drift scan run, we mask out detected sources and then fit a smooth function to the variation of the sky background. This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r 50 \textasciitilde{} 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data.},

  abstract = {'Approximate Bayesian Computation' (ABC) represents a powerful  methodology for the analysis of complex stochastic systems for which the likelihood of the observed data under an arbitrary set of input parameters may be entirely intractable - the latter condition rendering useless the standard machinery of tractable likelihood-based, Bayesian statistical inference [e.g. conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation]. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of ABC for astronomical model analysis by application to a case study in the morphological transformation of high-redshift galaxies. To this end, we develop, first, a stochastic model for the competing processes of merging and secular evolution in the early Universe, and secondly, through an ABC-based comparison against the observed demographics of massive (Mgal {$>$} 1011 M{$\odot$}) galaxies (at 1.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 3) in the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalatic Legacy Survey (CANDELS)/Extended Groth Strip (EGS) data set we derive posterior probability densities for the key parameters of this model. The 'Sequential Monte Carlo' implementation of ABC exhibited herein, featuring both a self-generating target sequence and self-refining MCMC kernel, is amongst the most efficient of contemporary approaches to this important statistical algorithm. We highlight as well through our chosen case study the value of careful summary statistic selection, and demonstrate two modern strategies for assessment and optimization in this regard. Ultimately, our ABC analysis of the high-redshift morphological mix returns tight constraints on the evolving merger rate in the early Universe and favours major merging (with disc survival or rapid reformation) over secular evolution as the mechanism most responsible for building up the first generation of bulges in early-type discs.},

  abstract = {We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a new Python tool which can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MultiNest algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) with BAGPIPES by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We show that a double-power-law model produces better agreement with realistic SFHs than an exponentially-declining model. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9312 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, \$M\_* {$>$} 10\^\{10\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$ and redshifts \$0.25 {$<$} z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} {$<$} 3.75\$. The majority of our quiescent sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over \$\textbackslash sim 1\{-\}2\$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. In addition, we identify two further subsets of objects with distinct SFH shapes. At \$z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} \textbackslash gtrsim 1\$ we find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of \$\textbackslash lesssim 1\$ Gyr. These objects are consistent with (potentially merger-triggered) quasar-mode AGN feedback. Also, at \$z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} \textbackslash lesssim 1\$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over \$\textbackslash gtrsim3\$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of a 'natural' quenching process, where galaxy SFHs die down gradually due to the diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. Purely passive evolution of the quiescent population at \$z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} \textbackslash gtrsim 0.5\$ is disfavoured by our results.},

  abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, \$z\textbackslash sim0.05\$ are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at \$z\textbackslash sim0.4\$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper we consider non-parametric SFH models.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{$>\sptilde$}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\textasciitilde 0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma\sptilde$}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\textasciitilde 0.2 Msolar and {$\sigma\sptilde$}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\textasciitilde n*\textasciitilde 0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {$>\sptilde$}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\textasciitilde 0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \textasciitilde 1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv\'enic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability. The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of H{$\alpha$} to H{$\beta$} luminosities, the H{$\alpha$} equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to {$\lambda$}-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to {$\lambda$}-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

In recent studies, emulators based on different machine learning techniques are used to emulate the outcomes of the population synthesis simulation with fast speed. In this study, we benchmark the performance of two emulators that learn the truncated power-law phenomenological model by using Gaussian process regression and normalizing flows techniques to see which one is a more capable likelihood emulator in the population inference. We benchmark the characteristic of the emulators by comparing their performance in the population inference to the phenomenological model using mock and real observation data. Our results suggest that the normalizing flows emulator can recover the posterior distribution by using the phenomenological model in the population inference with up to 300 mock injections. The normalizing flows emulator also underestimates the uncertainty for some posterior distributions in the population inference on real observation data. On the other hand, the Gaussian process regression emulator has poor performance on the same task and can only be used effectively in low-dimension cases.},

  abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its extensions such as Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) have become prominent techniques for blind sources separation (BSS), analysis of image databases, data mining and other information retrieval and clustering applications. In this paper we propose a family of efficient algorithms for NMF/NTF, as well as sparse nonnegative coding and representation, that has many potential applications in computational neuroscience, multi-sensory processing, compressed sensing and multidimensional data analysis. We have developed a class of optimized local algorithms which are referred to as Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) algorithms. For these purposes, we have performed sequential constrained minimization on a set of squared Euclidean distances. We then extend this approach to robust cost functions using the alpha and beta divergences and derive flexible update rules. Our algorithms are locally stable and work well for NMF-based blind source separation (BSS) not only for the over-determined case but also for an under-determined (over-complete) case (i.e., for a system which has less sensors than sources) if data are sufficiently sparse. The NMF learning rules are extended and generalized for N-th order nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF). Moreover, these algorithms can be tuned to different noise statistics by adjusting a single parameter. Extensive experimental results confirm the accuracy and computational performance of the developed algorithms, especially, with usage of multi-layer hierarchical NMF approach [3].},

  abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following: 1) including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z\textasciitilde 0 carry errors of \textasciitilde 0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z\textasciitilde 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the \textasciitilde 0.6 dex level; 2) either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the \textasciitilde 0.4 mag level in the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors blueward of the V-band.

  abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) provides the link between the stellar and dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In the present work, we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. These data include ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR photometry, surface brightness fluctuations, and integrated spectra of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), M87, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and photometry and spectral indices of both quiescent and post-starburst galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 0. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual \& Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05), and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: (1) the FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age dependence is incorrect; (2) all models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J - K and V - K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; (3) FSPS is able to fit all of the ultraviolet data because both the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) and horizontal branch evolutionary phases are handled flexibly, while the BC03 and M05 models fail in the far-UV, and both far- and near-UV, respectively; (4) all models predict ugr colors too red, D n 4000 strengths too strong, and H{$\delta$} A strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; and (5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D n 4000, and H{$\delta$} A strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch (HB) stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main-sequence turnoff). The different model predictions in the near-IR for intermediate age systems are due to different treatments of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stellar evolutionary phase. We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.},

To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to \$z=1.0\$. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to \$z=1.7\$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (\$ 2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5\$), for the Ly-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median \$z\textbackslash approx 0.2\$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

  abstract = {This paper describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the beta-divergence (beta-NMF). The beta-divergence is a family of cost functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).},

Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2 \texttimes{} 18203 resolution elements in a (106.5 Mpc)3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z = 0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.},

We introduce a simple modification for autoencoder neural networks that yields powerful generative models. Our method masks the autoencoder's parameters to respect autoregressive constraints: each input is reconstructed only from previous inputs in a given ordering. Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a set of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint probability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint probability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be applied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized implementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art tractable distribution estimators. At test time, the method is significantly faster and scales better than other autoregressive estimators.},

A recent approach is to learn the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators.

Here we present automatic posterior transformation (APT), a new sequential neural posterior estimation method for simulation-based inference. APT can modify the posterior estimate using arbitrary, dynamically updated proposals, and is compatible with powerful flow-based density estimators. It is more flexible, scalable and efficient than previous simulation-based inference techniques. APT can operate directly on high-dimensional time series and image data, opening up new applications for likelihood-free inference.},

This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

For summary statistics currently used in LSS, this assumption, even if the underlying density field is Gaussian, cannot be correct in detail. We investigate the impact of this assumption on two recent LSS analyses: the Beutler et al. power spectrum multipole (P{$\mathscr{l}$}) analysis and the Sinha et al. group multiplicity function ({$\zeta$}) analysis. Using non-parametric divergence estimators on mock catalogues originally constructed for covariance matrix estimation, we identify significant non-Gaussianity in both the P{$\mathscr{l}$} and {$\zeta$} likelihoods. We then use Gaussian mixture density estimation and independent component analysis on the same mocks to construct likelihood estimates that approximate the true likelihood better than the Gaussian pseudo-likelihood. Using these likelihood estimates, we accurately estimate the true posterior probability distribution of the Beutler et al. and Sinha et al. parameters. Likelihood non-Gaussianity shifts the f{$\sigma$}8 constraint by -0.44{$\sigma$}, but otherwise does not significantly impact the overall parameter constraints of Beutler et al. For the {$\zeta$} analysis, using the pseudo-likelihood significantly underestimates the uncertainties and biases the constraints of the Sinha et al. halo occupation parameters. For log M\_1 and {$\alpha$}, the posteriors are shifted by +0.43{$\sigma$} and -0.51{$\sigma$} and broadened by 42\{\{ per cent\}\} and 66\{\{ per cent\}\}, respectively. The divergence and likelihood estimation methods we present provide a straightforward framework for quantifying the impact of likelihood non-Gaussianity and deriving more accurate parameter constraints.},

These effects include dead time and photon pile-up, which can dramatically change the statistical inference of physical parameters from these observations. While dead time is difficult to take into account in a statistically consistent manner, simulating dead time-affected data is often straightforward. This structure makes the issue of inferring physical properties from dead time-affected observations fall into a class of problems common across many scientific disciplines. There is a growing number of methods to address them under the names of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), aided by new developments in density estimation and statistical machine learning. In this paper, we introduce SBI as a principled way to infer variability properties from dead time-affected light curves. We use Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation to estimate the posterior probability for variability properties. We show that this method can recover variability parameters on simulated data even when dead time is variable, and present results of an application of this approach to NuSTAR observations of the galactic black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105.},

For that reason, it has recently been gaining popularity as an analysis tool in cosmology and astrophysics. Its drawback, however, is a slow convergence rate. We propose a novel method, which we call qABC, to accelerate ABC with Quantile Regression. In this method, we create a model of quantiles of distance measure as a function of input parameters. This model is trained on a small number of simulations and estimates which regions of the prior space are likely to be accepted into the posterior. Other regions are then immediately rejected. This procedure is then repeated as more simulations are available. We apply it to the practical problem of estimation of redshift distribution of cosmological samples, using forward modelling developed in previous work. The qABC method converges to nearly same posterior as the basic ABC. It uses, however, only 20\% of the number of simulations compared to basic ABC, achieving a fivefold gain in execution time for our problem. For other problems the acceleration rate may vary; it depends on how close the prior is to the final posterior. We discuss possible improvements and extensions to this method.},

  abstract = {This Letter utilizes composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs)  constructed from NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey photometry to constrain the dust attenuation curve in 0.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.0 galaxies. Based on similarities between the full SED shapes (0.3-8 {$\mu$}m), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral classes and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a range in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well sampled in wavelength and show various spectral features including H{$\alpha$} and the UV dust bump at 2175 \AA. We fit all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population synthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV bump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV wavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong correlation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump strength, with steeper laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower dust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with inclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the dust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of both. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies. First, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived galaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in underestimated values for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant galaxies.},

  abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the ``gold standard'' for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes a priori. However, this flexibility is not fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here, we use the SED-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior star formation rate as a function of time (SFR(t)) is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of{\~ }6000 galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey and measure scatters between priors to be 0.1 dex in mass, 0.8 dex in SFR\textsubscript{100 Myr}, and 0.2 dex in mass-weighted ages, with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED fitting. High-quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t).},

Recently we have proposed that sophisticated panchromatic SED models can resolve this tension, as these methods infer systematically higher masses and lower star formation rates than standard approaches. In a series of papers we now extend this analysis and present a complete, self-consistent census of galaxy formation over \$0.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 3\$ inferred with the \textbackslash texttt\{Prospector\} galaxy SED-fitting code. In this work, Paper I, we present the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function using new mass measurements of \$\textbackslash sim\$10\$\^5\$ galaxies in the 3D-HST and COSMOS-2015 surveys. We employ a new methodology to infer the mass function from the observed stellar masses: instead of fitting independent mass functions in a series of fixed redshift intervals, we construct a continuity model that directly fits for the redshift evolution of the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly and makes use of the full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar mass inferences. The resulting mass function has higher number densities at a fixed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature, largely owing to the older stellar ages inferred by \textbackslash texttt\{Prospector\}. The stellar mass density is \$\textbackslash sim\$50\% higher than previous measurements, with the offset peaking at \$z\textbackslash sim1\$.

(1994)]\{ref19\}, and [Bessell et al. (1989, 1991)]\{ref6\}, respectively. The combined library has been intended for multiple-purpose synthetic photometry applications and was constructed according to the precepts adopted by [Buser \&amp; Kurucz (1992)]\{ref14\}: (i) to cover the largest possible ranges in stellar parameters (T\textsubscript{eff}, log g, and [M/H]); (ii) to provide flux spectra with useful resolution on the uniform grid of wavelengths adopted by [Kurucz (1995)]\{ref26\}; and (iii) to provide synthetic broad--band colors which are highly realistic for the largest possible parameter and wavelength ranges. Because the most astrophysically relevant step consists in establishing a realistic library, the corresponding color calibration is described in some detail. Basically, for each value of the effective temperature and for each wavelength, we calculate the correction function that must be applied to a (theoretical) solar-abundance model flux spectrum in order for this to yield synthetic UBVRIJHKL colors matching the (empirical) color-temperature calibrations derived from observations. In this way, the most important systematic differences existing between the original model spectra and the observations can indeed be eliminated. On the other hand, synthetic UBV and Washington ultraviolet excesses delta\_\{(U-B)\} and delta\_\{(C-M)\} and delta\_\{(C-T\vphantom\}\textsubscript{1})\vphantom\{\} obtained from the original giant and dwarf model spectra are in excellent accord with empirical metal-abundance calibrations ([Lejeune \&amp; Buser 1996]\{ref30\}). Therefore, the calibration algorithm is designed in such a way as to preserve the original differential grid properties implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes in the new library, if the above correction function for a solar-abundance model of a given effective temperature is also applied to models of the same temperature but different chemical compositions [M/H] and/or surface gravities log g. While the new library constitutes a first-order approximation to the program set out above, it will be allowed to develop toward the more ambitious goal of matching the full requirements imposed on a standard library. Major input for refinement and completion is expected from the extensive tests now being made in population and evolutionary synthesis studies of the integrated light of globular clusters ([Lejeune 1997]\{ref29\}) and galaxies ([Bruzual et al. 1997]\{ref10\}).},

The grid includes M dwarf model spectra, hence complementing the first library version established in Paper I (\textbackslash cite[Lejeune et al. 1997]\{leje97\}). It covers wide ranges of fundamental parameters: \{T\_eff\}: 50 000 K \textbackslash sim 2000 K, {$\lessgtr$}:break 5.5 \textbackslash sim -1.02, and \{[M/H]\}: +1.0 \textbackslash sim -5.0. A correction procedure is also applied to the theoretical spectra in order to provide color-calibrated flux distributions over a large domain of effective temperatures. For this purpose, empirical \{T\_eff\}-color calibrations are constructed between 11500 K and 2000 K, and semi-empirical calibrations for non-solar abundances (\{[M/H]\} = -3.5 to +1.0) are established. Model colors and bolometric corrections for both the original and the corrected spectra, synthesized in the (UBV)\_J(RI)\_CJHKLL'M system, are given for the full range of stellar parameters. We find that the corrected spectra provide a more realistic representation of empirical stellar colors, though the method employed is not completely adapted to the lowest temperature models. In particular the original differential colors of the grid implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes are not preserved below 2500 K. Limitations of the correction method used are also discussed.

  abstract = {Context. This is the third in a series of papers that develop a new and  flexible model to predict weak-lensing (WL) peak counts, which have been shown to be a very valuable non-Gaussian probe of cosmology.  Aims: In this paper, we compare the cosmological information extracted from WL peak counts using different filtering techniques of the galaxy shear data, including linear filtering with a Gaussian and two compensated filters (the starlet wavelet and the aperture mass), and the nonlinear filtering method MRLens. We present improvements to our model that account for realistic survey conditions, which are masks, shear-to-convergence transformations, and non-constant noise.  Methods: We create simulated peak counts from our stochastic model, from which we obtain constraints on the matter density {$\Omega$}m, the power spectrum normalisation {$\sigma$}8, and the dark-energy parameter w0de. We use two methods for parameter inference, a copula likelihood, and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We measure the contour width in the {$\Omega$}m-{$\sigma$}8 degeneracy direction and the figure of merit to compare parameter constraints from different filtering techniques. Results: We find that starlet filtering outperforms the Gaussian kernel, and that including peak counts from different smoothing scales helps to lift parameter degeneracies. Peak counts from different smoothing scales with a compensated filter show very little cross-correlation, and adding information from different scales can therefore strongly enhance the available information. Measuring peak counts separately from different scales yields tighter constraints than using a combined peak histogram from a single map that includes multiscale information. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a compensated filter function with counts included separately from different smoothing scales yields the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters from WL peaks.},

Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M {$\odot$} stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA.

Our pipeline utilizes a new way to select BGS galaxies using Gaia photometry and we implement geometrical and photometric masks that reduce the number of spurious objects. The resulting catalogue is cross-matched with the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey to assess the completeness of the galaxy catalogue and the performance of the target selection. We also validate the clustering of the sources in our BGS catalogue by comparing with mock catalogues and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Finally, the robustness of the BGS selection criteria is assessed by quantifying the dependence of the target galaxy density on imaging and other properties. The largest systematic correlation we find is a 7 per cent suppression of the target density in regions of high stellar density.},

Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 {$\mu$}m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 {$\mu$}m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 {$\mu$}m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 {$\mu$}m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 {$\mu$}m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 {$\mu$}m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 {$\mu$}m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux \textasciitilde 2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 {$\mu$}m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption.

The methodology, which builds on the one developed by Tabak and Vanden-Eijnden, normalizes the data points through the composition of simple maps.

Various candidates for the elementary maps of each step are proposed; criteria for choosing one includes robustness, computational simplicity, and good behavior in high-dimensional settings. A good choice is that of localized radial expansions, which depend on a single parameter: all the complexity of arbitrary, possibly convoluted probability densities can be built through the composition of such simple maps. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

With the fully Bayesian framework Prospector, we simultaneously fit the spectroscopic and photometric data with an advanced physical model (including non-parametric star-formation histories, emission lines, variable dust attenuation law, and dust and AGN emission) together with an uncertainty and outlier model. We show that both spectroscopy and photometry are needed to break the dust-age-metallicity degeneracy. We find a large diversity of star-formation histories: although the most massive (\$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}{$>$}2\textbackslash times10\^\{11\}\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) galaxies formed the earliest (formation redshift of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm f\}\textbackslash approx5-10\$ with a short star-formation timescale of \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm SF\}\textbackslash lesssim1\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$), lower-mass galaxies have a wide range of formation redshifts, leading to only a weak trend of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm f\}\$ with \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\$. Interestingly, several low-mass galaxies with have formation redshifts of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm f\}\textbackslash approx5-8\$. Star-forming galaxies evolve about the star-forming main sequence, crossing the ridgeline several times in their past. Quiescent galaxies show a wide range and continuous distribution of quenching timescales (\$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash approx0-5\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$) with a median of \$\textbackslash langle\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash rangle=1.0\_\{-0.9\}\^\{+0.8\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ and of quenching epochs of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash approx0.8-5.0\$ (\$\textbackslash langle z\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash rangle=1.3\_\{-0.4\}\^\{+0.7\}\$). This large diversity of quenching timescales and epochs points toward a combination of internal and external quenching mechanisms. In our sample, rejuvenation and "late bloomers" are uncommon. In summary, our analysis supports the "grow \& quench" framework and is consistent with a wide and continuously-populated diversity of quenching timescales.},

Here, we summarize the science cases in terms of provisional plans for a 300-night Subaru survey. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via a survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3 h-3 Gpc3 in the redshift range 0.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.4. In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be measured to 3\% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth to 6\% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 106 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams as faint as V \texttildelow{} 22, including stars with V {$<$} 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple {$\alpha$}-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic stars. For the galaxy evolution program, our simulations suggest the wide wavelength range of PFS will be powerful in probing the galaxy population and its clustering over a wide redshift range.

We propose and implement a deep unsupervised machine learning method to summarize the entire diversity of MaNGA spectra onto a 15x15 map (DESOM-1), where neighbouring points on the map represent similar spectra. We demonstrate our method as an alternative to conventional full spectral fitting for deriving physical quantities, as well as their full probability distributions, much more efficiently than traditional resource-intensive Bayesian methods. Since spectra are grouped by similarity, the distribution of spectra onto the map for a single galaxy, i.e., its "fingerprint", reveals the presence of distinct stellar populations within the galaxy indicating smoother or episodic star-formation histories. We further map the diversity of galaxy fingerprints onto a second map (DESOM-2). Using galaxy images and independent measures of galaxy morphology, we confirm that galaxies with similar fingerprints have similar morphologies and inclination angles. Since morphological information was not used in the mapping algorithm, relating galaxy morphology to the star-formation histories encoded in the fingerprints is one example of how the DESOM maps can be used to make scientific inferences.},

DEVILS is a deep spectroscopic redshift survey with very high completeness, covering several premier deep fields including COSMOS (D10). Our stellar mass and SFR estimates are self-consistently derived using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling code PROSPECT, using well-motivated parametrizations for dust attenuation, star formation histories, and metallicity evolution. We show how these improvements, and especially our physically motivated assumptions about metallicity evolution, have an appreciable systematic effect on the inferred stellar masses, at the level of \textasciitilde 0.2 dex. To illustrate the scientific value of these data, we map the evolving galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) and the SFR-M{$\star$} relation for 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 4.25. In agreement with past studies, we find that most of the evolution in the SMF is driven by the characteristic density parameter, with little evolution in the characteristic mass and low-mass slopes. Where the SFR-M{$\star$} relation is indistinguishable from a power law at z {$>$} 2.6, we see evidence of a bend in the relation at low redshifts (z {$<$} 0.45). This suggests evolution in both the normalization and shape of the SFR-M{$\star$} relation since cosmic noon. It is significant that we only clearly see this bend when combining our new DEVILS measurements with consistently derived values for lower redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey: this shows the power of having consistent treatment for galaxies at all redshifts.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale  hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 \texttimes{} 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

  abstract = {We study the star formation histories (SFHs) and mass-weighted ages of  331 UVJ-selected quiescent galaxies in 11 galaxy clusters and in the field at 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.5 from the Gemini Observations of Galaxies in Rich Early ENvironments (GOGREEN) survey. We determine the SFHs of individual galaxies by simultaneously fitting rest-frame optical spectroscopy and broad-band photometry to stellar population models. We confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more massive galaxies having on average earlier formation times. Comparing galaxies found in massive clusters with those in the field, we find galaxies with M* {$<$} 1011.3 M{$\odot$} in the field have more extended SFHs. From the SFHs we calculate the mass-weighted ages, and compare age distributions of galaxies between the two environments, at fixed mass. We constrain the difference in mass-weighted ages between field and cluster galaxies to \$0.31\_\{\^\{-0.33\}\}\^\{\_\{+0.51\}\}\$ Gyr, in the sense that cluster galaxies are older. We place this result in the context of two simple quenching models and show that neither environmental quenching based on time since infall (without pre-processing) nor a difference in formation times alone can reproduce both the average age difference and relative quenched fractions. This is distinctly different from local clusters, for which the majority of the quenched population is consistent with having been environmentally quenched upon infall. Our results suggest that quenched population in galaxy clusters at z {$>$} 1 has been driven by different physical processes than those at play at z = 0.},

  abstract = {We extend the colour calibration of the widely used BaSeL standard stellar library (Lejeune et al. 1997, 1998) to non-solar metallicities, down to [Fe/H] \textasciitilde{} -2.0 dex. Surprisingly, we find that at the present epoch it is virtually impossible to establish a unique calibration of UBVRIJHKL colours in terms of stellar metallicity [Fe/H] which is consistent simultaneously with both colour-temperature relations and colour-absolute magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on observed globular cluster photometry data and on published, currently popular standard stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones. The problem appears to be related to the long-standing incompleteness in our understanding of convection in late-type stellar evolution, but is also due to a serious lack of relevant observational calibration data that would help resolve, or at least further significant progress towards resolving this issue. In view of the most important applications of the BaSeL library, we here propose two different metallicity calibration versions: (1) the ``WLBC 99'' library, which consistently matches empirical colour-temperature relations and which, therefore, should make an ideal tool for the study of individual stars; and (2), the ``PADOVA 2000'' library, which provides isochrones from the Padova 2000 grid (Girardi et al. \textbackslash cite\{padova\}) that successfully reproduce Galactic globular-cluster colour-absolute magnitude diagrams and which thus should prove particularly useful for studies of collective phenomena in stellar populations in clusters and galaxies.},

  abstract = {Cosmological inference becomes increasingly difficult when complex  data-generating processes cannot be modeled by simple probability distributions. With the ever-increasing size of data sets in cosmology, there is an increasing burden placed on adequate modeling; systematic errors in the model will dominate where previously these were swamped by statistical errors. For example, Gaussian distributions are an insufficient representation for errors in quantities like photometric redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult to quantify analytically the distribution of errors that are introduced in complex fitting codes. Without a simple form for these distributions, it becomes difficult to accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as a function of parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) provides a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation of a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to bypass direct calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the ability to simulate the forward process that generated the data. These simulations can naturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance parameters, and hence these can be marginalized in a natural way. We present and discuss ABC methods in the context of supernova cosmology using data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. Assuming a flat cosmology and constant dark energy equation of state, we demonstrate that ABC can recover an accurate posterior distribution. Finally, we show that ABC can still produce an accurate posterior distribution when we contaminate the sample with Type IIP supernovae.},

  abstract = {We combine hierarchical Bayesian modeling with a flow-based deep generative network, in order to demonstrate that one can efficiently constraint numerical gravitational wave (GW) population models at a previously intractable complexity. Existing techniques for comparing data to simulation,such as discrete model selection and Gaussian process regression, can only be applied efficiently to moderate-dimension data. This limits the number of observable (e.g. chirp mass, spins.) and hyper-parameters (e.g. common envelope efficiency) one can use in a population inference. In this study, we train a network to emulate a phenomenological model with 6 observables and 4 hyper-parameters, use it to infer the properties of a simulated catalogue and compare the results to the phenomenological model. We find that a 10-layer network can emulate the phenomenological model accurately and efficiently. Our machine enables simulation-based GW population inferences to take on data at a new complexity level.},

  abstract = {Fast and automated inference of binary-lens, single-source (2L1S) microlensing events with sampling-based Bayesian algorithms (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo; MCMC) is challenged on two fronts: high computational cost of likelihood evaluations with microlensing simulation codes, and a pathological parameter space where the negative-log-likelihood surface can contain a multitude of local minima that are narrow and deep. Analysis of 2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-loop domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-free inference (LFI) approach named amortized neural posterior estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a surrogate posterior \$\textbackslash hat\{p\}(\textbackslash theta|x)\$ as an observation-parametrized conditional probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors within seconds for any observation within the prior support without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior could then be refined into the exact posterior with a downstream MCMC sampler with minimal burn-in steps.},
