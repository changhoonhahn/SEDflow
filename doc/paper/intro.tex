\todo{paragraph on SED modeling}

\todo{paragraph on SED Modeling with a full Bayesian approach}
- marginalize over nuisance parameters
- accurately capture degeneracies among model parameters
- allows informative priors based on prior observations

\todo{limitation of Bayesian SED modeling} 
- These methods involve sampling a high dimensional space of SED model
parameters. 
- The dimensionality only increases as SED models become more sophisticated
both in terms of stellar population synthesis modeling and accounting for
observational effects.  
- State-of-the-art methods use MCMC or HMC to efficiently sample a high
dimensional parameter space. Go through all the latest works and detail their
dimensionality and setups. 
- Despite the use of modern sampling techniques, SED modeling take hundreds of
hours per galaxy. Even for $\sim 4000$ galaxies in the LEGA-C ESO Public
Spectroscopic Survey~\cite{}, this required 3.5 million CPU hours {\sc
Bagpipes}. 

\todo{simulation based inference}
provide an overview of simulation based inference 

the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Survey~\citep[DESI;][]{desicollaboration2016}, the Prime Focus
Spectrograph~\citep[PFS;][]{takada2014}, Rubin~\chedit{CITATION}, and
Roman~\chedit{CITATION}.
