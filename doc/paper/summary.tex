\section{Summary} \label{sec:summary}
By analyzing the SED of a galaxy, we can infer detailed physical properties
such as its stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and dust content. 
These properties serve as the building blocks of our understanding of how
galaxies form and evolve. 
Current state-of-the-art SED modeling methods use MCMC sampling to perform 
Bayesian statistical inference. 
They derive posterior probability distributions of galaxy properties given
observation that accurately estimate uncertainties and parameter degeneracies. 
Posteriors also enable marginalization over any nuisance parameters. 
For the dimensionality of current SED models, this requires ${\gtrsim}100,000$
model evaluations and take ${\gtrsim}10-100$ CPU hours per galaxy. 

Upcoming galaxy surveys, however, will observe \emph{millions} of galaxies
using \emph{e.g.} DESI, PFS, Rubin observatory, James Webb Space Telescope, and
the Roman Space Telescope. 
Analyzing all of these galaxies with current Bayesian SED models is infeasible
and would require \emph{billions} of CPU hours. 
Furthermore, computational costs will only multiply as SED models increase in 
sophistication and treat theoretical uncertainties more flexibly. 
Therefore, rigorous inference will soon be a major bottleneck for galaxy
studies.

\begin{itemize}
\item we present galaxy SED modeling using ANPE and the recent provabgs sed model 
some detail about training 
Using a trained ANPE, we derive posteriors of galaxy properties in  1 second
\item We demonstrate the
We apply our ANPE SED modeling on test mock observations and compare them to
posteriors derived using MCMC sampling. 
\item we apply ANPE to infer posteriors of galaxy properties. 
For each galaxy, we infer posteriors of $M_*$, SFR, mass-weighted stellar
metallicity, mass-weighted age. 
The catalog of posteriors is publicly available at \url{urlhere}
\end{itemize}

In this work, we focus on SED modeling of optical photometry. 
Next step is to explore galaxy spectra.
